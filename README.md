# RootInvest - Defi on RootStock


Welcome to **RootInvest**, a decentralized application (dApp) empowering users to interact with diverse cryptocurrency investment strategies directly on the secure **Rootstock network**. Connect your wallet (like Metamask) to explore a marketplace of "Decks" â€“ curated investment strategies created by the community or the platform.

This platform allows you to browse various investment approaches, from yield farming to growth token baskets, all within the Rootstock ecosystem which leverages Bitcoin's security. Invest using the platform's native token (PTK), track your portfolio's performance, withdraw profits, and even create your own Decks for others to join. An integrated AI provides snapshot overviews of deck statistics to offer additional perspective.
